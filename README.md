# Firebase Asynchronous Data Handling Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications involving asynchronous data retrieval and provides a solution using promises or async/await.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases an incorrect approach to accessing data from a Firebase Realtime Database asynchronous call. Directly accessing data before it's fully fetched can result in unexpected errors and undefined values.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous operations by utilizing promises or async/await. This ensures the data is available before being accessed, preventing errors.
